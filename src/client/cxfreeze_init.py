#   Initialization script for cx_Freeze which manipulates the path so that the
# directory in which the executable is found is searched for extensions but
# no other directory is searched. The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
# manipulated first, however, to ensure that shared libraries found in the
# target directory are found. This requires a restart of the executable because
# the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is only checked at startup.
