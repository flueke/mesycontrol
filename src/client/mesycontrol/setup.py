# Operations:
# * Load Setup:
#   for each MRCConfig:
#     establish connection if needed
#     for each DeviceConfig:
#       load DeviceConfig (target mrc is the parent of the DeviceConfig)
#   result -> multiple (MRCConnection + MRCModel tree) objects

# * Load single MRCConfig from setup:
#   same as above but only the selected MRCConfig

# * Apply single MRCConfig to target mrc:
#   assert target exists and is ready
#   for each DeviceConfig:
#       load DeviceConfig (target mrc is the given target, not the DeviceConfigs parent!)

# * Apply single DeviceConfig to device:
#   assert target device exists and is ready
#   assert DeviceConfig.idc matches target idc
#   apply DeviceConfig to target

# * Diff current device states and Setup device states
#   for each MRCConfig:
#     establish connection if needed
#     for each DeviceConfig:
#       read target device parameters
#       diff the device memory and DeviceConfig contents {0: (0, 1), 1: (123,
#       None), ...} (None only if all params should be diffed and Setup does
#       not contain the param
#       store/return the diff somehow
#   Where are the diffs kept? Who updates them?

# => Setup: Load only (into the gui), Connect only, Connect and diff, Connect
# and load device configs, Connect and set meta information (device names and
# descriptions)
# => MRCConfig: as for Setup but an optional target MRC can be supplied (use
# case: one client runs the server, another clients wants to modify the setup
# -> it needs to connect to the first clients server address)
# Better long term solution: run the server standalone and change the
# MRCConfig.connection_config accordingly

# Change tracking:
# * Changes to parameter values, object names, descriptions and so on must be
#   tracked. The source Setup should be marked as modified. On close the user
#   must be asked if he wants to save the changes. It should be possible to
#   disable change tracking (i.e. close the source Setup but keep the connection open).
#   DeviceModel.name changes -> DeviceConfig.name must change too
# * The user must be able to add/remove MRCs and devices from/to a setup.
#   For now this could be implemented by creating a new setup containing the
#   desired devices and overwriting the old setup.
#   How does this work? We'd have two setups: the one that was originally
#   loaded and a new one reflecting the user-made changes.
# * Model tree <-> observer <-> Setup tree

# Complicated case:
# A Setup has been successfully loaded.
# A single DeviceConfig is applied to a device that's also contained in the Setup.
# Should the device be removed from the setup? Should the new DeviceConfig
# replace the existing config in the setup? => Replace is probably better. The
# original Setup gets modified, the newly loaded DeviceConfig is not modified.

# Complicated case 2:
# A setup has been successfully loaded.
# The user wants to load and apply a different setup.
# The new setup must replace the old setup. The old setup should be closed and
# changes be written to disk if desired.
# How to handle a device that was present in the old setup but is not present
# in the new setup? It's not modified by loading the setup but it also is not
# contained in the setup so it will not be saved. The user must be able to mark
# the device to be included in the setup. => Device selection needed.

# Error handling and reporting when loading setups:
# * Errors: connection failed (timeout, server error, ...), device not found,
#   device idc mismatch, read/write error, permission denied (needs write
#   access), verification error (if verification is enabled).
#   The above errors are easy to catch and report. By default SetupLoader
#   quits after the first error it encounters. This means the setup may have
#   been partially loaded.
#   => Report the error via popup and in the logs and be done with it.
