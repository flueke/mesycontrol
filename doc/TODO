* server
  - replace iostream logging with boost::log
  - exception safety
  - retry mrc init sequence a couple of times
  - timeouts
  - rework request dispatcher as it doesn't know about which TCPConnection
    queues a request
  - add max connections feature
  - add master feature
  - add notification messages (see protocol below)

* protocol
  - add master client feature so that only one client has write access
  - add parameter_set, silent_mode_changed, master_changed, etc. notifications
    (param set is important if using multiple gui clients. they should be
    notified about changed params)
  - add status request to get the status of the mrc connection (e.g. connected, reconnecting, ...)

* gui client
  - XXX: fix the duplication of DeviceDescription in DeviceConfig and DeviceViewModel
  - disconnect support
  - present all mrcs and devices in some nice widget
  - allow bus rescans, reconnects, etc.
  - open device window on click. by default uses a device specific widget if
    present, otherwise (and by user request) opens the device as a generic
    device
  - load and save device description files
  - load and save device config files, optionally including the description
    (needed for generic devices _if_ saved with named parameters) as otherwise
    the config can't be loaded. Alternative: prompt for a generic device
    description.

* cli client
  - commands and grammar
  - non blocking, timeout aware client (could probably re-use the gui TCPClient)
  - multi connection support. Needs a way to specify which mrc to address with commands
  - commands: connect, connections list, disconnect, set, read, scanbus, load
    device config, read device config (could be added just like a mrc
    connection), verify device state == expected device config state
  - expressions:
    * compare param value to a given value / another param (eq, gt, lt, le, ...)
