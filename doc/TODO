* enumerate com ports
* Source layout, package building, installation need improvement
* application_model initialization
* Sort out and document DeviceModel, DeviceViewModel, DeviceDescription.
* Handle changes to scanbus data. Needs to be observable.
* Track config sources. Ask about unsaved changes.
* Improve Command:
  - get first/all failed subcommand(s) from CommandGroups
  - add __str__ to Commands

* Logging: use instance specific loggers for some classes or find another way
  to track logs from individual instances
  -> LoggerAdapter seems to be the solution

* Virtual connections:
  - load setup to virtual connections
  - create new virtual, add/remove devices from virtual

* How to handle the RC setting? For MHV4 enabling/disabling RC can be dangerous.
  -> User can easily change it

* Server:
  - exception safety
  - timeouts
  - add max connections feature
  - add rc_changed notification (bus, dev, rc_new)
  - scanbus(3) shuts down the mrc connection cause of a timeout. fix this!
    the command 'sc 3' results in only one line of output: 'ERROR!' no other
    output is generated.

* Scripting:
  - Standalone vs. running inside the GUI
  - Wrapper documentation

* build system
  - fix cxfreeze prefix issue on windows
  - fix slow performance on windows

STARTED - DeviceDescription: add conversion to human readable units (<unit label="mA" factor="1000.0")
DONE - DeviceDescription: add value range to parameters (min, max). Make sure input in SI units is rounded correctly
  - DeviceDescription: add version detection (MSFC-16)
  - DeviceDescription: add a flag to mark system descriptions
  - DeviceDescription: add a way to copy a description
  - DeviceConfig: add a way to store MRC connection info in the configuration
  - DeviceConfigXML: use attributes instead of nested tags for simple stuff (makes the XML file shorter)
  - DeviceConfigXML: add DTD (used for verification)
